#### -- Project Status: [in progress]

## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is to study women's life satisfaction to raise awareness on the problem of gender inequality by performing descriptive analysis of the below-listed sources using Python:
- the Better Life Index data set provided by OECD (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development), analyzed factors: employment rate, long-term unemployment rate, life expectancy, self-reported health, employees working very long hours, time devoted to leisure and personal care, educational attainment, students' skills, expected years in education, water quality, homicide rates, feeling safe walking alone at night, social network support, life satisfaction. The data provided in the source mostly comes from years 2019 and 2020, with few exceptions differing by country/factor that date back to years 2006-2018. 
- the GDP data set provided by OECD. Data analysed comes from years 2020-2022.

### Methods Used
* Data loading, exploration, cleaning, summary - libraries used: pandas, pandassdmx, requests.
* Mathematical operations - library used: numpy
* Predictive modeling and evaluation of performance of predictive models - library used: scikit-learn
* Data visualization, correlation analysis - libraries used: matplotlib, seaborn

### Technologies
* Python
* Jupyter
* HTML?

## Project Description
(Provide more detailed overview of the project.  Talk a bit about your data sources and what questions and hypothesis you are exploring. What specific data analysis/visualization and modelling work are you using to solve the problem? What blockers and challenges are you facing?  Feel free to number or bullet point things here)

## Needs of this project

- frontend developers
- data exploration/descriptive statistics
- data processing/cleaning
- statistical modeling
- writeup/reporting
- etc. (be as specific as possible)

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo (for help see this [tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/)).
2. Raw Data is being kept [here](Repo folder containing raw data) within this repo.

    *If using offline data mention that and how they may obtain the data from the froup)*
    
3. Data processing/transformation scripts are being kept [here](Repo folder containing data processing scripts/notebooks)
4. etc...

*If your project is well underway and setup is fairly complicated (ie. requires installation of many packages) create another "setup.md" file and link to it here*  

5. Follow setup [instructions](Link to file)
