We will be using various tools and skills, such as Jupyter, pandas, data cleaning and processing, matplotlib, numpy, pandas visualization, and data analysis, to conduct our analysis within the project timeline of 4 weeks.\n","\n","The first step of the analysis will be to define the research question and set up the notebook. We will then prepare the data by selecting relevant columns and cleaning it as needed. After that, we will compare the Life Satisfaction scores of women to the overall data in the Better Life Index, identifying areas where women's needs are overlooked when not studied separately.\n","\n","One of the key questions we will seek to answer is the relationship between GDP and the Life Satisfaction Index. Our analysis will determine if the places where women are happier or more satisfied are also those with a high or better GDP. This information motivate countries to invest in policies that aim to promote gender equality and improve the well-being of women?.\n","\n","Moreover, we will explore other questions such as how the Life Satisfaction scores of women compare to those of men, the most significant factors that contribute to the Life Satisfaction scores of women in the Better Life Index, if there are any countries where women have higher Life Satisfaction scores than men, and what factors contribute to this difference.\n","\n","We think the project timeline is realistic, and the tools and skills covered in the Data Specialization course will be instrumental in conducting the analysis.\n","\n","In conclusion, we believe that this project is essential as it uses data analysis to focus on women's experiences and tackle the issue of gender inequality. Our goal is to find out where women are not treated fairly and make plans to make their lives better. The project timeline is realistic, and the tools and skills covered in the Data Specialization course will be instrumental in conducting the analysis. We hope that itthis project will also help to raise awareness aboutof the importance of considering women's experiences when analyzing data, and promotinge the need for policies that support gender equality.\n","\n","\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"OB2Klvwe-bf7"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**Question 2** [20 points]    \n","Explain your target audience.   \n","Who could be interested in reading your final report and for whom will your project be useful?

After discovering that the project is a significant challenge, both in terms of level of knowledge needed and time consumption, some of us started to think and work quickly and hard to grasp the demands and produce the basis for the project while others tried to shy away both from the challenges the project created and communication about it. This situation caused that the project work was divided very unequally between group members which after a few days showed small signs of bad atmosphere in the group and in the long run would cause emotionally charged clashes within the group. With the help of our instructor and some management tools, namely [project timeline and workload division between every member of the group](https://trello.com/b/jdzyYyIX/cfg-degree-project) that was created using trello and [worktime schedule](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zzpWKr9WPPcU-xUjTYkw2zRYsFOCDEIXMJ2wV4P5uOM/edit#gid=0) created in excel, we are trying to create the balance between workload each member of the group undertakes and executes and we are aiming to create the secure and predictable workspace where everybody can devote to the project work and avoid emotional burden.     \n","\n","In the following days we plan to assign the work tasks from the worktime schedule to single people, similarly to the division of the tasks in this homework, with the intention that once it is in the common file, others can read it, consult, disagree and propose changes to the content. For the moment the small subtasks from data cleaning section are divided among people who volunteer to do sth by our content leader, described below. Now, when I’m thinking about how to improve our group work, it is possible we will need to encourage different members of the group to clearly voice their needs. Since people have different temperaments, there is a visible difference within the group when it comes to voicing needs by the particular members.  \n","\n","I feel in our group two leaders emerged, content and organizational one. The leaders emerged by taking initiative in these two domains. The content leader created the basis for the work and points to the next necessary steps in the data analysis. The organizational one tries to facilitate the workflow, e.g. communicating ideas about organization of the work. From what I know from psychology, the institution of self-appointed leaders is a way to work in a group, but it is far from being ideal, since it is best if all group members accept the volunteering leaders. This thema should be discussed within the group asap.\n","\n","We are at the beginning of our group work and there was little time to evaluate if the tools, mentioned above, work. Therefore we might change or adjust the attitude described above. We will be also grateful for any tips or insights from you, because this kind of a project is a novelty for each member of our group and it is always better to use a wheel than to invent it on one's own.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"Qv5aRP_G_UTf"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"lyZ5u-w4n12L"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**Question 4/2**    \n","Describe the team approach to the project work:   \n","what are your team’s strengths and weaknesses?"],"metadata":{"id":"MUq6UGFq_V2c"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Answer:   \n","\n","**Strengths:**\n","\n","\n","* Different backgrounds: In our team, we have diverse backgrounds.
